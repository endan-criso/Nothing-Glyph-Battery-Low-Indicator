<h4>This is a simple Android project for messing around with Nothing Phone Glyph lights using the official Glyph API.

It shows how to connect to the Glyph framework and trigger light effects directly from an Android app. This repo mainly exists as a reference / playground for developers who want to experiment with Nothing’s Glyph Interface and see how it behaves in real time.</h4>

<h3>Notes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>This is written in Kotlin, even though Nothing never bothered to post any Kotlin samples in their docs.</li>
  <li>Right now, it only works on Nothing Phone 2a.</li>
  <li>Nothing has removed the API access key from their website, which limits broader testing.</li>
  <li>Tested on Nothing Phone 2a running Android 15.</li>
</ul>
